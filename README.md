## 🕯️ About This Project

In this repository, we tell the stories of the people shot and killed by the Islamic Regime of Iran during the bloody protests of 2026.

Current estimates place the number of lives lost at **40,000**, while some sources indicate the death toll may be as high as **100,000**.

This project exists to ensure that these individuals are never viewed as just numbers. We aim to humanize the statistics, tell their stories, and document exactly what happened to them.

## 🚨 The Situation
While we document the fallen, many more Iranians are currently being detained and tortured while awaiting execution. This repository serves as a tool to spread the word and keep their memories alive.

## 🛠️ Project Features
* **Memorial Gallery:** A somber, respectful archive of victims including images and their stories.
* **Downloadable PDFs:** Users can click "Print" to generate a PDF containing the victim's image and a QR code to share their story offline.
